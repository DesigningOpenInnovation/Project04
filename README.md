Group project: We are starting a project for a "Neighbourhood meeting place" for connecting people in suburbs and above. 
Our service will be funded by the government or the local municipalities but run by the community itself. The community selects a board for the place yearly who will be in charge of taking care of all matters from housekeeping to funding. 
This is the mutual place for neighbours to meet each other, arrange parties, happenings, courses etc. and to have a possibility to rent it for private events.

Group members: Katri Ollila, Tatyana Chuzhanova, Annu Jokinen, Erika Ahlberg
